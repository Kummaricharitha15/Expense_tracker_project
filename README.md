🧾 Daily Expense Tracker – Python Project

A simple and beginner-friendly Python project that helps you track your daily expenses.
Each expense you enter is stored permanently in a file along with the date, and you can view today’s total or the total of all days anytime.

📂 How It Works

The project uses Python file handling to store all expenses in a text file:

expenses.txt

Each line in the file looks like this:

2025-11-27|100|Lunch

Whenever you enter a new expense, it gets appended to this file so that data never gets lost — even if you close the program.
